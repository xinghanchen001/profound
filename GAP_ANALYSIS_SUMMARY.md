## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Competitive Intelligence Engine
The target product's core value is **competitive positioning**. Current implementation lacks:
- Competitor identification and tracking
- Comparative performance metrics
- Competitive ranking algorithms
- Trend analysis vs competitors

### 2. Citations-Based SEO for AI
This is the "answer engine optimization" differentiator:
- Track which websites AI platforms cite
- Analyze citation patterns by topic/platform
- Provide recommendations to increase citation share
- Monitor website's citation performance

### 3. Topic-Driven Analysis
Instead of generic metrics, everything is organized by topics:
- Corporate credit cards ‚Üí Virtual business cards ‚Üí Startup cards
- Each topic has its own competitive landscape
- Drill-down capability from high-level to specific topics

### 4. Platform-Specific Insights
Different AI platforms have different preferences:
- ChatGPT citation patterns vs Perplexity vs Google AI
- Platform-specific optimization recommendations
- Cross-platform performance comparison
