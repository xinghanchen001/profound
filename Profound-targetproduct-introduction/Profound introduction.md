00:00 Hey everybody, how's it going? This is the walkthrough of the Profound platform, as you will see it. Uh, excited to be here, excited to chat with you all.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.15.26.png]]


00:08 So, welcome to Profound. At the highest level, Profound is a platform that allows brands to understand, take action, and tangibly improve their visibility in AI search across answer engines like ChadGBT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, and Microsoft Copilot.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.17.03.png]]
00:26 And the way Profound does that is Profound asks those answer engines, really interrogates answer engines, with thousands of questions every single day on behalf of your brand.

00:36 To give you a sense of the scale, I can even head into the export here and see thousands of questions every single day about your brand.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.17.30.png]]
00:45 We check if you're mentioned, we pull in the raw response. We look based on the region, and we even pull citations.

00:51 So those actual websites that the answer engines access and use as a source of truth for their, uh, answers. We pull it through, we make it visible to you, we let you understand how this actually changes and manifests, uh, your brand.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.17.55.png]]
01:04 in this new generative search world. Okay, that's the high level. Let's get a little more granular here. So when you leap into profound, you're gonna be met with the overview page.

01:16 The overview page is like the launch pad to the entire platform. It is the starting point, the genesis of your journey through AI search.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.18.28.png]]
01:24 So the first thing you can do is you can hit the view your insights page to jump right into answer engine insights.

01:30 You can hit right into managing your prompts and modifying your prompts to jump into our amazing prompt designer. You can go into learn how it is.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.18.52.png]]
01:37 You can go into the agent analytics area. You can also go to the agents slash actions part of the platform as well.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.19.14.png]]
01:47 It is extremely exciting. You can also see some of your top metrics as well. So you can see your visibility score.

01:52 You can see your website. Activity from agent analytics here populated as well. If you have agent analytics connected and you can see top keyboards from conversation explorer, if you've got conversation explorer ungated as well, you can also see some top actions from our actions panel.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.19.44.png]]
02:06 Really, this is like I said, the launch panel. So let's just jump in manually over to answer engine insights just like this and let's see what's going on.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.20.05.png]]
02:15 You've got a high level visibility score. It meets you right at the top of the page and the visibility score is really the golden metric to understand your brand's health and A.I.

02:25 search. Visibility is computed as the percent of responses where your brand shows up at some point. So it doesn't have to be the first word.

02:32 It doesn't have to be the last word of the response. It just has to be that American Express in this instance does show up and And the score rank itself is the stack rank.

02:41 of all the key brands. So American Express is first, Ramp is second, Brecks is third, Capital One is fourth, Chase is fifth.

02:47 One of the most interesting features of the platform is if you're curious to see your competitors' data and you want to see the stack rank, all you have to do is click and it will load the competitor data and you can see how their visibility changes.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.21.21.png]]
02:57 You can also see, clicking the Compare Competitors button, just how your visibility is shifting and changing over time. One key thing about visibility, though, before we leave this page, is that visibility is calculated as the average of the time range that you're looking at.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.21.36.png]]
03:11 So if we look at the last four weeks, we're looking at the average visibility for American Express across those last four weeks, and we can compare previous period, again, we can compare competitors, all those beautiful things are very easy to do here.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.21.58.png]]
03:24 I will touch on Share of Voice very briefly. Share of Voice is the computed percent of the brand mentions compared to everyone else's brand.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.22.42.png]]
03:32 So, to put that in a simple sense, visibility calculates whether or not you show up in the answer. So if there are 100 questions, 100 queries that we send off to the answer engines, and you appear in 100 of those responses, that's 100% visibility.

03:46 If there are 100 responses, and in those responses, we see 500 brands mentioned, and American Express is mentioned 100 times across all of those responses, so there's 500 total brands mentioned, and American Express is mentioned 100 times, your share of voice versus the responses you appear in versus

04:14 all responses for visibility. Hope that makes sense there. For prompts, let's just jump right into prompts. The prompts tab is incredi![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.23.44.png]]bly powerful.

04:24 You can see each of your topics laid out specifically showing their visibility, your rank in that visibility area. So for corporate card software, Amex is ranking number 48.

04:35 They're the 48th most visible. For virtual business credit cards, Amex is 10th most visible. And we can see the visibility scores.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.24.16.png]]
04:42 We can also click in to analyze the specific topic. So we can see comparing competitors, exactly how Amex is. Amex shapes up across this specific topic.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.24.41.png]]
04:52 And if we jump back, we can even get more granular. You might ask, all right, what's next? What's next is the prompts.

04:59 So these prompts are generated by our prompt generation model. It is an LM fine-tuned on million- of real conversations and prompts given AI.

05:10 So we can take any topic, any industry, any tag that you have, and we can turn that into long-tail, actual, uh, like, realistic feeling AI search prompts.

05:21 Which is really incredible. So we can look right into this prompt, which would have been auto-populated by our system. Also, secondarily, you can come with your own prompts.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.25.22.png]]
05:29 So you don't need to rely on our system. If you have your own prompts that you know you want to run, we can absolutely just run those prompts.

05:35 But we can see specifically for best virtual credit. The card option for small businesses, MX is forty-four percent visible on average.

05:43 And we can see that MX does not have any visibility from chat GPT. They've got a lot of visibility from co-pilot, only a little from Google A, overviews and just 66% from perplexity.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.25.53.png]]
05:53 So the biggest opportunity here for MX is to get visible in chat GPT and overviews to start bringing that visibility number up.

06:00 We can also view specific executions. So this I think is just as good, if not as, if not better, than seeing a screenshot of the response, because you can see the actual text of the response.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.26.07.png]]
06:09 The actual brands responded to by Microsoft co-pilot when it was actually asked this question, best virtual credit card option for small businesses, plus the citation that Microsoft co-pilot did.

06:21 And you can also export this completion as well. You can scroll through each of these. And if you. You're really thinking about the, the answer engine optimization and what resources and what pages get cited to answer this question.

06:32 Look no further than the citations view here. You can actually see. The, the actual pages on a prompt by prompt level that influence this answer.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.26.26.png]]
06:41 So if you want. If you to influence this answer, you could get on these specific pages, which you can see, uh, MX in this case is on the Topalti page to boost your influence and boost your visibility there.

06:53 Great. On this view as well, we have our prompt designer. Prompt designer is really exciting. The prompt designer allows you to add a new prompt.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.26.58.png]]
07:00 I'm just going to add some gibberish here. You can add a language here. You can add a tag if you want it, and you can add a region.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.27.10.png]]
07:07 You can also add topics. You can add any topic you want. You can name your topic. You can add prompts as well.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.27.33.png]]
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.27.44.png]]

![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.28.18.png]]
07:14 So. So long as you stay within your prompt limit there. What's really important is that you do have to click save if you wanted to save your prompts.

07:23 I'm not going to save them. I'm going to go back. I'm going to discard my changes. I don't want it to have random prompts in here.

07:29 But. If you did want to go through and save it, you should save it. Uh, make sure you save it.

07:34 Everything in the platform, again, I want to make sure this is clear, is filterable by topic and platform as well.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.29.01.png]]
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.29.20.png]]
07:40 So if we go to something like the platforms view, I can see our visibility by each of these major ads or engines.

07:46 Each of these major platforms, you know, we can see MX is 45%. Oh wait, here we go. Let's see. Let's go back into MX here.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.29.32.png]]
07:54 MX is 45% visible into LGBT 55 in Google. I overview is 53 in co-pilot and 68 in perplexity. And we can see.

08:02 That over time, temporally as well, which is really exciting. So we can see the temporal shifts in visibility there as well.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.30.05.png]]
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.30.26.png]]
08:08 Extremely exciting. And if we wanted to, we could filter by topic as well so we can jump down and we could say just for corporate card software, how visible are we?
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.30.44.png]]
08:17 How does that visibility shave up? That's what this is all about. We can show it to you by region. Regions are great.

08:22 We love regions here at Profound. You can see how your visibility shapes up across different regions as well as the citations page.

08:30 The citations page is really incredible. So let's take a second to dive in here. When you jump into the citations page, the first thing you're going to be met with is a citation share percent.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.30.58.png]]
08:39 Citation share percent is the percentage of all answers. I'm sorry, the percentage of all citations that are actually using your website.

08:47 So when an answer engine goes out to the internet, to find- information, to decide what information, what it's going to say the truth is, what it's going to say the answer is.

08:56 Mx is 1% of that resource list. That's actually relatively significant as well. So, Mx basically owns 1% of the- truth around corporate cards.

09:08 But we can see specifically if we change the topic that Mx goes down, Mx goes up, we can see corporate cards.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.31.34.png]]
09:16 I'm sure Mx will go slightly higher. 1.2%. Uh, if we go to virtual business credit cards, Mx will go down 0.8% if we look all across, it's around 1%.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.32.11.png]]
09:26 We can also filter by platform and we can see how things shape up there. But before we do that, I want to call it to attention some really interesting features we have.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.32.00.png]]
09:33 We have the ability to click into specific domains. We can see specifically under the Mx domain. Or the nerd want domain.

09:40 Let's just do nerd want for a second. Which pages are cited the most often? So I can see this page, nerd while at best credit card, small business accounts for 19.8%.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.32.38.png]]
09:50 So this 19.8% share accounts for 19.8% of all of it. Nerd while at citations. So a pretty big chunk of nerd while at citations just come from this single page.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.33.15.png]]
10:00 On the prompts level, we can see the prompts that trigger a nerd while at citation. On the topics view, we can see the individual topics where nerd while at is most cited.

10:08 So interestingly, nerd while it doesn't get many citations. For corporate card policy, they get tons of citations for corporate credit cards.

10:14 So if I was nerd while at, I would say a great opportunity would be to put out some more corporate card policy pages.

10:21 On the platform view, we can see how nerd while at is cited across co-pilot, perplexity and chat GPT, not so cited across Google.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.33.26.png]]
10:27 A.I. overviews. We can do the same thing for Amex. What's really interesting across any of these is you can also dig into a second layer.

10:33 So if I just go and I click on a simple page, I can see individually for that page. This page here, amex.com slash US credit cards, business, best credit cards.

10:43 I can see the prompts that trigger this individual page, the topics that trigger this page. Sometimes I can see the text chunks that the answer engines pull out of the page, as well as the platform by platform citations.

10:54 And I want to demonstrate to you just how that changes. So we've got two views here. These are the top domains.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.35.16.png]]
10:59 These are the top pages. If I jump in and look here, specifically at the chat GPT citations, they changed so much that if I was going to look at something like, I don't know, the Microsoft copilot citations, right?

11:11 Huge shift across domains. Pretty significant there. If we look at the page by page. If you, the same thing as well.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.34.57.png]]
11:17 So if I go to chat GPT, I can see a lot of nerd wallet. I jump out, not so much.

11:21 So there's real abandoned preferences by each of these answer engines. There's, again, I'm going to mention this, there's three different types of citation.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.34.38.png]]
11:29 Earned is pretty much our massive bucket. It's everything that's not a competitor, a social or an owned piece. Owned is basically your own site.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.35.52.png]]
11:37 Uh, social is social media. Competitors are your identified competitors. I don't have any identified competitors. In this industry. So, no need there.

11:45 Umm. We also have the ability to show this nice 3D graph of the actual citation landscape, which is really exciting.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.36.23.png]]
11:54 You can see all the different publishers and domains that are showing up in. There, as well. We've also got my website, which is an overview of how actual answer engines use scrape, access, and refer traffic to your pages.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.36.42.png]]
12:10 Broken out by the key answer engines. Broken out by the specific pages you're looking at so I can show you.

12:15 Each of your pages I could say, hey, check, take a look at this page. We've got 547 total bot visits.

12:21 532 came from ChatGPT. It was last index three hours ago and we actually have the logs to show that. We can also show you the recent visits here, Amazon Index Stars.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.37.00.png]]
12:31 ChatGPT the AI Assistant. Actually, so that means that an actual user probably asked something like, what is answer engine optimization?

12:37 ChatGPT scraped our page to use it as a citation. So in real time, we can get a sense for people are actually asking about us or our content.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.37.42.png]]
12:46 We can see ChatGPT. We can see it broken up. by user agent. ChatGPT user being the main one. So that's when an actual person uses ChatGPT.

12:53 GPT bot is AI training. So GPT is just like vacuing up all of our site content. OpenAI search bot is their indexing bot.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.38.15.png]]
13:01 And OpenAI operator is the operator, of course. And we can see the logs. We can actually see the actual raw logs here in real time, mind you, as well as referral traffic going piece by piece.

13:12 We can see how many people were actually giving an actual site experience to people clicking from ChatGPT onto our pages.

13:20 We can also see conversations. Conversations are great. So we can see something like, uh, business credit, right? We can see this is actual ChatGPT citation volume gathered from 40 plus data panels over the last three, four, five, six months.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.38.34.png]]
13:34 We've been putting this together as a- massive priority from the business. It is the first of its kind. It is real, uh, ChatGPT query volume from actual answer engine conversations.

13:44 It starts extremely high level. This- this high level business credit is basically an amalgamated cluster of a bunch, you know, hundreds of- thousands of long tail queries that we basically, uh, make the parent, it basically represents hundreds of different queries with tiny little variations.

14:01 That basically mean that, uh, we can model out at the topic level basically how often people are asking these questions across, Cross out.

14:08 The chat TPT, which is incredible. We can see related keywords there as well. This is conversation Explorer. We're extremely excited about it.

14:14 And then we also have actions. Some really, uh, high level actions. This is really one of the newest areas of the platform.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.39.36.png]]
14:21 We are going to be pushing on this massively the ability to actually Um, you know, take action in the platform.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.39.48.png]]
14:27 We have some tools here that you can actually use to throw some, uh, both some blogs together and start to optimize your URL slugs, as well as starting to think about some of the different actions, high level implementation steps in rationale.
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.40.05.png]]
![[Screenshot 2025-07-22 at 12.40.28.png]]
14:39 Thank much for watching, and I'll see you I'm really excited to have you un-profound, really excited to give you the opportunity to see how we work and what we do.

14:45 Uh, thanks so much. If you have any questions, please reach out. Thank you all. Bye bye.
